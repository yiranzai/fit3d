# Project Constitution

**Project:** Fit3D  
**Version:** 1.1.0  
**Ratified:** 2024-12-19  
**Last Amended:** 2024-12-19

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles and governance framework for Fit3D. These principles are non-negotiable and must guide all development decisions, architectural choices, and operational practices.

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Free and Open Source

**All software MUST be released under a permissive open source license that allows free use, modification, and distribution.**

- Code MUST be publicly accessible and freely available
- Dependencies MUST be limited to open source libraries and frameworks
- Documentation MUST be comprehensive and freely accessible
- Community contributions MUST be welcomed and properly attributed
- No proprietary or commercial restrictions on usage

**Rationale:** Ensures maximum accessibility, community adoption, and long-term sustainability while preventing vendor lock-in.

### Principle 2: Code Quality Excellence

**All code MUST meet rigorous quality standards with comprehensive documentation and maintainable architecture.**

- Code MUST follow established style guides and linting rules
- Functions and classes MUST have clear, single responsibilities
- Code MUST be self-documenting with meaningful variable and function names
- Complex logic MUST include inline comments explaining business rules
- Architecture MUST follow SOLID principles and design patterns
- Technical debt MUST be tracked and addressed in regular maintenance cycles

**Rationale:** High code quality reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and enables efficient collaboration across development teams.

### Principle 3: Comprehensive Testing Standards

**All functionality MUST be covered by automated tests with measurable coverage thresholds.**

- Unit tests MUST achieve minimum 90% code coverage
- Integration tests MUST cover all external API interactions
- End-to-end tests MUST validate critical user workflows
- Performance tests MUST establish baseline metrics and regression detection
- Tests MUST be fast, reliable, and maintainable
- Test failures MUST block deployment until resolution
- Mocking MUST be used appropriately to isolate units under test

**Rationale:** Comprehensive testing ensures reliability, prevents regressions, and enables confident refactoring and feature development.

### Principle 4: User Experience Consistency

**All user interfaces MUST provide consistent, intuitive experiences across all touchpoints.**

- Design systems MUST be established and strictly followed
- UI components MUST be reusable and maintain visual consistency
- User workflows MUST be logical and minimize cognitive load
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) MUST be met
- Error messages MUST be clear, actionable, and user-friendly
- Loading states and feedback MUST be provided for all user actions
- Responsive design MUST work across all supported devices

**Rationale:** Consistent UX reduces user confusion, improves adoption rates, and builds trust in the application.

### Principle 5: Performance Requirements

**All systems MUST meet strict performance benchmarks and scale efficiently.**

- Page load times MUST be under 2 seconds for initial render
- API response times MUST be under 200ms for 95th percentile
- Database queries MUST be optimized and use appropriate indexing
- Caching strategies MUST be implemented for frequently accessed data
- Resource usage MUST be monitored and optimized continuously
- Scalability MUST be designed for horizontal growth
- Performance budgets MUST be established and enforced

**Rationale:** Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, conversion rates, and operational costs.

### Principle 6: Chinese Language Support

**All user-facing content and documentation MUST provide comprehensive Chinese language support to serve the Chinese-speaking community.**

- User interfaces MUST support Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) as the primary language
- Documentation MUST be available in both Chinese and English
- Error messages and system feedback MUST be localized in Chinese
- Code comments and technical documentation MUST include Chinese explanations for complex logic
- Community communication channels MUST support Chinese language discussions
- Localization testing MUST be included in the testing strategy
- Chinese language input methods MUST be fully supported
- Date, time, and number formatting MUST follow Chinese locale standards

**Rationale:** As a Chinese project, comprehensive Chinese language support ensures accessibility for the primary user base, improves user experience, and enables effective community engagement.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. Proposed amendments MUST be documented with clear rationale
2. Community feedback MUST be solicited for a minimum of 7 days
3. Amendments require consensus from core maintainers
4. Version MUST be incremented according to semantic versioning
5. All dependent templates and documentation MUST be updated

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Backward incompatible principle changes or removals
- **MINOR (X.Y.0):** New principles added or significant guidance expansion
- **PATCH (X.Y.Z):** Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

- Quarterly reviews of principle adherence MUST be conducted
- Automated checks MUST validate code quality and testing standards
- Performance metrics MUST be continuously monitored
- User experience audits MUST be performed before major releases

### Enforcement

- Pull requests MUST pass all automated quality gates
- Code reviews MUST verify principle compliance
- Performance regressions MUST be addressed before merge
- Documentation MUST be updated for any architectural changes

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow

1. All changes MUST be made through pull requests
2. Automated tests MUST pass before review
3. Code review MUST verify principle compliance
4. Performance impact MUST be assessed for significant changes
5. Documentation MUST be updated for user-facing changes

### Quality Gates

- Linting and formatting checks MUST pass
- Test coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds
- Performance benchmarks MUST not regress
- Security scans MUST pass without critical issues
- Accessibility audits MUST pass for UI changes

### Monitoring and Metrics

- Code quality metrics MUST be tracked and reported
- Test coverage MUST be monitored and maintained
- Performance metrics MUST be continuously measured
- User experience metrics MUST be collected and analyzed
- Error rates and system health MUST be monitored
