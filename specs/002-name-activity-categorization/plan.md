## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Fit3D - Outdoor Sports Data Management
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Timeline:** 6 months (3 phases: CLI v1.0, Mobile v2.0, Desktop v3.0)

## Objectives
- Build a cross-platform outdoor sports data management application using web technologies
- Implement local data storage with SQLite/DuckDB for trajectory file management
- Create an extensible activity categorization system supporting hiking and cycling
- Develop 3D motion tracking video generation with customizable parameters
- Ensure comprehensive Chinese localization for the Chinese-speaking community

## Technical Architecture
### Core Components
- **Web-based CLI Interface**: Node.js-based command-line tool with web technologies
- **Local Database Layer**: SQLite/DuckDB for efficient local data storage and querying
- **Activity Categorization Engine**: Automatic detection and classification system
- **3D Visualization Engine**: WebGL-based video generation with Three.js
- **Map Generation Service**: Web-based trajectory visualization with Mapbox/Leaflet
- **Localization Service**: i18n support for Chinese and English interfaces

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript for web interfaces, Electron for desktop, React Native for mobile
- **Backend:** Node.js with TypeScript, Express.js for API services
- **Database:** SQLite for local storage, DuckDB for analytical queries
- **Testing:** Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E tests, Playwright for cross-platform testing

## Quality Assurance
### Testing Strategy
- Unit Testing: 90% minimum coverage with comprehensive test suites
- Integration Testing: Database operations, file processing, and API endpoints
- E2E Testing: Complete user workflows across all platforms
- Performance Testing: Large dataset handling (1000+ activities), video generation benchmarks

### Code Quality
- Linting: ESLint with TypeScript rules, Prettier for code formatting
- Code Review: Pull request reviews with constitutional compliance checks
- Documentation: Comprehensive API documentation in Chinese and English

## User Experience
### Design System
- Consistent web-based UI components across all platforms
- Material Design principles with custom outdoor sports theme
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Dark/light mode support with accessibility considerations

### User Workflows
- **Import Workflow**: Drag-and-drop FIT/GPX files → automatic categorization → data validation
- **Visualization Workflow**: Select activities → choose visualization type → customize parameters → generate output
- **Management Workflow**: Browse activities → filter by category → edit metadata → export data

### Chinese Localization
- Complete Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) interface translation
- Chinese documentation and help system
- Chinese input method support for search and data entry
- Chinese date/time/number formatting throughout the application

## Performance Requirements
### Benchmarks
- Page Load: < 2 seconds for web interfaces
- API Response: < 200ms for database queries, < 5s for map generation, < 30s for 3D video generation
- Database Queries: Optimized with proper indexing for GPS data and category filtering

### Monitoring
- Performance monitoring with Web Vitals for web interfaces
- Database query performance tracking
- Memory usage monitoring for large dataset operations
- User experience metrics collection and analysis

## Risk Assessment
- **Large Dataset Performance**: Mitigation through efficient database indexing and pagination
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Mitigation through comprehensive testing on target platforms
- **3D Video Generation Complexity**: Mitigation through progressive enhancement and fallback options
- **Chinese Localization Quality**: Mitigation through native speaker review and testing

## Success Criteria
- Successfully import and categorize 1000+ FIT/GPX files with 95% accuracy
- Generate high-quality 3D motion tracking videos with customizable parameters
- Achieve 90% test coverage across all components
- Complete Chinese localization with native speaker approval
- Cross-platform functionality working seamlessly on CLI, mobile, and desktop

## Technical Context Integration

Based on the user requirements:
- **Local Storage**: All trajectory files will be stored locally using SQLite/DuckDB for efficient data management
- **Web Technologies**: Maximum use of web technologies (React, TypeScript, WebGL) for cross-platform implementation
- **Database Choice**: SQLite for primary storage, DuckDB for analytical queries and complex data processing
- **Cross-platform Strategy**: Web-based core with platform-specific wrappers (Electron, React Native)

This approach ensures:
- Fast local data access without network dependencies
- Consistent user experience across all platforms
- Efficient data processing for large datasets
- Easy maintenance and updates through web technology stack
